# PROGRESS.md — Libreta

Living document. Update as work progresses. Latest at the top.

> Convention: each session/work-block adds a dated entry. Keep entries short — link to commits/PRs for detail. The "Status" line at the top must always reflect reality.

## Status

**Current milestone**: M1 — Read-only wiki
**Phase**: Skeleton up; backend serves tree + page reads, frontend renders markdown
**Next action**: Add CI, pre-commit hooks, more markdown features (mermaid, callouts), then begin M2

## Log

### 2026-05-01 — M0/M1 scaffold

Initial code lands. Backend and frontend both boot; the read path works end-to-end on the seed corpus.

- `backend/`: FastAPI app, `uv`-managed, with `/api/v1/{healthz,readyz,info,pages/tree,pages/{path}}`. Path validation in `storage/paths.py`; page reading + tree walking in `storage/pages.py`. Strict typed errors; `LibretaError` → JSON via central handler. **18 pytest tests pass; `ruff check` clean; `mypy --strict` clean.**
- `frontend/`: Vue 3 + Vite + TS + Tailwind + Pinia + Vue Router. `PageTree` sidebar, `PageView` route, typed API client. Markdown rendered via `markdown-it` + GFM-style plugins + highlight.js. Raw HTML disabled at render (P4/R6). **5 vitest tests pass; `vue-tsc --noEmit` clean; `pnpm build` succeeds.**
- `docker-compose.yml`: three services (`api`, `frontend` under `dev` profile, `drawio`). Bind-mounts `./data/content`.
- `data/content/`: seeded with `pages/index.md` and a couple of recipe pages, initialised as its own git repo with one commit (per CLAUDE.md §6.3).
- Architecture doc updated to describe the three-service dev / two-service prod layout.

Deferred from M0: CI, pre-commit hooks. Will land in a follow-up.

### 2026-05-01 — Project kickoff

Created foundational documents:
- `README.md`
- `PROJECT.md` — vision, principles, non-goals
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — full technical architecture
- `ROADMAP.md` — milestones M0 → M5+
- `PROGRESS.md` — this file
- `CLAUDE.md` — conventions for Claude Code

Stack decisions locked in:
- Backend: Python 3.12 + FastAPI + pygit2 + SQLite FTS5, managed with uv
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite + Tiptap + Tailwind, managed with pnpm
- Diagrams: jgraph/drawio sidecar, integration via iframe + postMessage
- Storage: filesystem-first git repo at `./data/content`; auxiliary search index lives in a separate Docker volume, regenerable from the filesystem

Open questions logged in `ARCHITECTURE.md` "Open questions" section.

**Next session**: M0 kickoff — initialise the repo, create both skeletons, get `docker compose --profile dev up` working end-to-end.

## Decisions log

Significant architectural or product decisions that are worth remembering. Format: date · short description · rationale.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-01 | Build from scratch rather than fork Wiki.js or wrap BookStack | No existing tool combines markdown-on-disk + git-canonical + drawio + WYSIWYG. Forking either inherits architectural mismatches. |
| 2026-05-01 | Python / FastAPI for the backend | Stated user preference; fits the lightweight async API shape. |
| 2026-05-01 | pygit2 over GitPython | libgit2 bindings are faster and have stricter, well-defined semantics. |
| 2026-05-01 | Diagrams as `.drawio.svg` (not `.drawio` + separate render) | Single file, renders as image anywhere, editable in drawio. Best portability story. |
| 2026-05-01 | SQLite FTS5 for search; no separate search service | Adequate for 10k pages; no extra container; regenerable from filesystem. |
| 2026-05-01 | "Libreta" as working name | Placeholder; rename via find-replace before first public release if desired. |
| 2026-05-01 | Defer auth to M6 | Single-user-first per `PROJECT.md` P6. Multi-user is a large design problem that benefits from real usage before being designed. |

## How to update this file

When you finish a chunk of work:

1. Update the **Status** block at the top.
2. Update the **At a glance** milestone table if a milestone moved.
3. Add a dated entry to **Log** describing what changed, in 3-8 bullet points.
4. If a non-trivial decision was made, append to the **Decisions log**.
5. Move any "I noticed but didn't fix" items into **Backlog**.

Commit this file alongside the work it documents.
